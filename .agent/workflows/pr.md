# /pr — Production-Grade Pull Request Workflow

> **Trigger**: `/pr [target]` (default: `main`) · `/pr --draft [target]`
> **Lifecycle**: Ship — after `/preflight` readiness passes, before `/deploy`

> [!CAUTION]
> PR creation pushes code to remote and triggers CI pipelines. Always run local pre-flight checks via `/review` before pushing. Never create PRs with unresolved conflicts or failing tests. Every CI run consumes pipeline credits.

> [!TIP]
> This workflow leverages the **git-workflow** skill. Read `.agent/skills/git-workflow/SKILL.md` for extended guidance on branching, conventional commits, and PR templates.

## Scope Filter

| Commit Type | PR Mode | Gates Skipped |
| :---------- | :------ | :------------ |
| `feat()` — new features | ✅ Full (8 steps) | None |
| `fix()` — bug fixes | ✅ Full (8 steps) | None |
| `refactor()` — structural | ✅ Full (8 steps) | None |
| `perf()` — performance | ✅ Full (8 steps) | None |
| `chore()` — maintenance | ⚠️ Lightweight | Step 3 (pre-flight) |
| `docs()` — documentation | ⚠️ Lightweight | Steps 3, 7 (pre-flight, CI) |
| `test()` — test additions | ⚠️ Lightweight | Step 3 runs test gate only |

## Critical Rules

0. **NO ARTIFACT FILES** — NEVER save API responses, diffs, or intermediate data as files in the project directory. Process ALL data in memory via shell pipes, variables, or direct tool output
1. **ALWAYS** detect the project's branch strategy before validating target — prevents wrong-base PRs
2. **ALWAYS** sync with target branch before creating PR — prevents merge conflicts
3. **ALWAYS** run pre-flight `/review` locally before pushing — catches issues pre-CI
4. **NEVER** create a PR from `main` or `production` branches
5. **NEVER** create a PR with known conflicts — resolve first
6. **NEVER** merge without all CI checks passing
7. **ATOMIC** PRs — one logical unit of work per PR, not multi-sprint kitchen sinks
8. **CONVENTIONAL** titles — `type(scope): description` format, validated before creation
9. **SIZE GUARD** — PRs exceeding XL threshold (50+ files or 1500+ LOC) must be split

## Argument Parsing

| Command | Action |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `/pr` | Create PR targeting integration branch (`dev` if GitFlow, `main` if trunk-based) |
| `/pr [target]` | Create PR targeting specified branch (e.g., `/pr dev`) |
| `/pr --draft` | Create PR as draft (may not trigger CI) |
| `/pr --draft [target]` | Create draft PR targeting specified branch |

---

## Steps

Execute IN ORDER. Stop at first failure.

### Step 1: Verify Branch State & Detect Branch Strategy

// turbo

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --porcelain
```

- If on `main` or `production` → **STOP**, instruct user to create feature branch
- If working tree dirty → prompt to commit or stash

**1a. Detect Branch Strategy** (per `pr-toolkit` skill):

```bash
# Check for GitFlow indicators
git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(dev|develop)$'
```

- If `dev`/`develop` exists → **GitFlow** detected
- If only `main`/`master` → **Trunk-Based** detected
- Record detected strategy for Step 1b validation

**1b. Validate Target Branch**:

| Strategy | Source Pattern | Valid Target | Invalid Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GitFlow | `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*` | `dev`, `develop` | `main` → **BLOCK** |
| GitFlow | `hotfix/*` | `main` | — |
| GitFlow | `release/*`, `dev` | `main` | — |
| Trunk-Based | Any feature branch | `main` | — |

- If target is invalid → **STOP**: "Branch strategy violation — `{branch}` should target `{valid_target}`, not `{invalid_target}`"
- If user explicitly provided target via `/pr [target]` → validate against strategy, warn if non-standard

### Step 2: Sync with Target Branch

// turbo

```bash
git fetch origin <target>
git merge origin/<target> --no-edit
```

- If conflicts detected → invoke **Conflict Resolution Protocol** (see below)
- If clean merge → proceed to Step 2.5

### Step 2.5: PR Size & Scope Guard

// turbo

**2.5a. Size Classification** (per `pr-toolkit` size matrix):

```bash
# Count changed files and lines
git diff --name-only origin/<target>..HEAD | wc -l
git diff --stat origin/<target>..HEAD | tail -1
```

| Size | Files | LOC | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| XS-M | 1-30 | < 700 | Proceed |
| L | 31-50 | 700-1500 | **WARN**: "Large PR — consider splitting for faster review" |
| XL | 50+ | 1500+ | **BLOCK**: "PR exceeds reviewability threshold — split into focused PRs" |

**2.5b. Scope Coherence Check**:

```bash
# Categorize changed files by directory/purpose
git diff --name-only origin/<target>..HEAD
```

Detect mixed concerns:
- Source code (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`) alongside framework config (`.agent/`, `.github/`)
- Feature code alongside unrelated dependency bumps
- Multiple unrelated modules changed with no shared dependency

If scope violation detected → **WARN**: "PR contains mixed concerns — recommend splitting: [split suggestions]"

> [!WARNING]
> If the branch has diverged significantly from the target, expect conflicts in shared files like `.gitignore`, `package.json`, or lock files. Always check `git diff --name-only origin/<target>..HEAD` before creating the PR.

### Step 3: Run Pre-Flight Checks

// turbo

**3a. Verify /preflight status** (for `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf` commit types):
- Check if `/preflight` scorecard exists in conversation context
- If scorecard exists and status is Production Ready or Conditionally Ready → proceed
- If no scorecard found → warn: "Consider running `/preflight` before `/pr` for full production readiness validation"
- For lightweight commit types (`chore`, `docs`, `test`) → skip this check

**3b. Run /review pipeline** (Gates 1-5: lint, type-check, test, security, build):

Delegate to `/review` pipeline.

- Scope filter applies:
  - `docs()` → skip all gates
  - `chore()` → skip test + build gates
  - `test()` → run test gate only
  - All others → full pipeline
- If any gate fails → stop, fix, re-run

> [!CAUTION]
> If ANY pre-flight check fails, fix it BEFORE proceeding. Do NOT rely on CI to catch issues — that wastes pipeline credits and delays the team.

### Step 4: Push to Remote

```powershell
git push origin HEAD
```

- If rejected (upstream diverged) → re-run Step 2, then retry push
- If authentication error → guide user to configure credentials

### Step 5: Generate & Validate PR Title & Body

// turbo

**Title generation** (per `pr-toolkit` title parser):

1. Parse branch name using branch-to-title algorithm:
   - Extract type: `feature/` → `feat`, `bugfix/` → `fix`, `hotfix/` → `fix`, `chore/` → `chore`
   - Remove ticket prefix: `ABC-123-` → strip
   - Extract scope from first segment, description from remainder
   - Compose: `type(scope): description`
2. Fallback: use first commit message subject line
3. **Validate** the generated title:
   - Must match `type(scope): description` or `type: description`
   - Type must be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`
   - Description must be imperative mood, under 72 characters, no trailing period
   - If validation fails → prompt user to provide/correct title

**Body generation:**
- Populate from `git log origin/<target>..HEAD --oneline` and `git diff --stat origin/<target>..HEAD`
- Include **PR Size Label**: `[XS/S/M/L]` in body metadata
- Use **PR Body Template** (see below)
- Verify body contains: Summary, Changes, Test Plan sections

### Step 6: Create PR

**Pre-check:** Query existing PRs for current branch. If open PR exists → offer to update title/body instead of creating new.

**MCP-first 3-tier fallback:**
1. Attempt `mcp_github-mcp-server_create_pull_request` with title, body, `is_draft`, base, head
2. If MCP fails → attempt `gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --base <target> [--draft]`
3. If `gh` fails → provide pre-formatted title + body for manual browser copy-paste

### Step 7: Verify CI Pipeline

- Poll via `mcp_github-mcp-server_pull_request_read` (method: `get_status`)
- Report each check as it resolves
- If draft PR → note: "Draft PRs may not trigger CI on some repositories. Convert to ready-for-review via MCP `update_pull_request` if CI doesn't appear."

> [!NOTE]
> If CI checks do NOT appear, check:
> 1. **Merge conflicts** — `mergeable_state: dirty` blocks CI entirely
> 2. **Workflow file** — `.github/workflows/` must contain CI config on the target branch
> 3. **Branch targeting** — CI may only trigger on PRs targeting specific branches

### Step 8: Handle Results

- ✅ All green → offer to assign reviewers via `update_pull_request`, link issues with `Closes #N`
- ❌ Any fail → read failure logs, suggest fix, re-run from Step 3
- ⏳ Timeout → provide manual check instructions

## PR Body Template

```markdown
## Summary
[One-line description derived from branch name and commits]

## Changes

### [Category — derived from commit types]
- [Change description from commit messages]

## Test Plan
- [x] Pre-flight `/review` passed locally (lint, type-check, test, security, build)
- [x] Branch synced with `{target}` — no conflicts
- [x] No secrets or PII in diff

## Breaking Changes
[None / List any breaking changes — derived from `BREAKING CHANGE:` commit footers]

## Related Issues
[Closes #N — derived from commit messages or branch name pattern]
```

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

When merge conflicts are detected in Step 2:

```powershell
# 1. Check conflicted files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# 2. Resolve each conflict manually
#    - .gitignore: combine both versions, prefer more restrictive
#    - Package manifests (package.json, pubspec.yaml): merge dependencies carefully
#    - Source files: understand both changes, merge logically

# 3. Mark resolved and commit
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts with <target>"

# 4. Re-run pre-flight checks (Step 3)
# Invoke /review to verify merge didn't break anything

# 5. Resume from Step 4 (Push)
```

## Governance

**PROHIBITED:**
- Creating PRs from `main` or `production` branches
- Creating PRs targeting wrong branch per detected strategy (e.g., feature→main in GitFlow)
- Creating PRs with unresolved merge conflicts
- Creating XL PRs (50+ files or 1500+ LOC) without splitting
- Pushing without local pre-flight `/review` passing
- Merging PRs with failing CI checks
- Including generated files, PII, secrets, or `.env` in diff
- Multi-sprint mega-PRs — keep PRs focused and reviewable
- Non-conventional PR titles (raw branch names, vague descriptions)
- Using `// turbo` on state-mutating steps (push, create, merge)
- Skipping failed steps · proceeding without resolution

**REQUIRED:**
- Branch strategy detection before target validation
- Target branch validation against detected strategy
- PR size classification and scope coherence check
- Branch sync with target before every PR
- Local pre-flight via `/review` before push
- Conventional commit PR title format (validated)
- Structured PR body using template (Summary, Changes, Test Plan)
- CI verification after PR creation
- Human approval before push and PR creation (non-turbo)
- MCP-first with graceful fallback strategy
- Conflict resolution before push
